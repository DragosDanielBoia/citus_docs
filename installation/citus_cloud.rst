Managed Service
==================

One of the easiest ways to get started with Citus is to spin up a cluster in
the cloud on Azure. The Citus managed service is available as
`Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL
<https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/postgresql/introduction/>`_, formerly known as Hyperscale (Citus) in Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

To get started, you can take advantage of our Citus on Azure `quickstart
documentation
<https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/postgresql/quickstart-create-portal>`_,
or go straight to the `Azure Portal
<https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_DocumentDB/CreatePostgreSQL.ReactView>`_ to provision an
Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL cluster. (And if you don't yet have an Azure account, just `create
a free Azure account <https://azure.microsoft.com/free/>`_—or take advantage of the `free trial <https://cosmos.azure.com/try/>`_.)
